# Interior Design by Shamique Etienne

## Introduction:
My interior design project is a full-stack CRUD application based on designing a client's home office. I chose it due to my love for home styling and interior design. It consists of a homepage, an about me section, and the ability for clients to post a perfectly styled office to their liking. Clients are then able to edit their forms and update their photos to another photo of their choice. In order to access the viewpage, clients must sign in using their google accounts.
